* What is CCL?

  From [[https://ccl.clozure.com][CCL's Home Page]]:

  #+begin_quote
  Clozure CL (often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp implementation
  with a long history. Some distinguishing features of the implementation
  include fast compilation speed, native threads, a precise, generational,
  compacting garbage collector, and a convenient foreign-function interface.

* What's in the image?

  This image contains CCL binaries built from the latest binary releases from
  the CCL devs for a variety of OSes and architectures.

  The general policy for OS support is that images will be built for two
  versions of supported OSes: either the two most recent versions or the latest
  LTS and most recent version, as applicable.
